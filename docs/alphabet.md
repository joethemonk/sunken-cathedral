### **The Tidal Futhark**

This runic script, found carved into the weeping walls of the Sunken Cathedral, is the written language of the Cathedral's long-lost inhabitants. It is known to the Lamplighter's lineage as the Tidal Futhark, for its characters seem to ebb and flow like the tides themselves.
